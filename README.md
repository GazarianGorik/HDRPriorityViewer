# HDR Priority Graph
HDR Priority Graph is a visual helper tool for Wwise projects that allows you to visualize your HDR setup on an interactive graph.
It provides a clear overview of your project and lets you open elements directly in Wwise for editing, ensuring consistency across your project.

<br>

## ‚å®Ô∏è Features & Commands

- **Interactive visualization**: Zoom and pan through your HDR setup.
  - *Right mouse button selection, Scrollwheel + optionnal Ctrl or Alt keys for Vertical / Horizontal zoom)*
    
- **Filters & search**: Quickly hide or highlight specific elements.
  - *Left pannel*
    
- **Interactive points**: Open audio objects in Wwise directly from the graph.
  - *Ctrl + Click on a point*

## üîé How it works

1. **WAAPI Data Retrieval**
   - Connects to your Wwise session to get basic project data: busses, events, and their target audio objects rooted to an HDR bus, along with `.wwu` file locations.

2. **Project Scanning via `.wwu` files**
   - Retrieves HDR priority data, including:
     - Voice volume
     - Voice volume random ranges
     - Voice volume affected by States
     - RTPCs on both audio objects and their busses

3. **Chart Display**
   - Elements are displayed based on the **‚Äúfixed‚Äù volume setup**, combining:
     - Audio object voice volume
     - Parent object volume
     - Bus volume
     - Parent bus volume

4. **Display Logic**
   - If a target audio object has children with specific volume setups, the tool recursively displays its children.
   - Otherwise, the audio object itself is displayed.

> Depending on project complexity, the graph may contain many elements. Using filters or search bars is recommended.  
> **Tip:** Apply the default filter for large projects, especially on low-spec PCs.

## ‚ùì Safety

- The tool **does not modify `.wwu` files** or send any WAAPI commands that write to your project.
- Always save your work before using the tool, as large graphs may freeze your system.
- A performance warning popup is shown when too many elements are about to be displayed.
